# üöÄ Node.js TypeScript Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project for building Node.js applications using TypeScript. It includes a basic setup for Express.js, custom logging middleware, and route management.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-app.git

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn start:dev
   ```

## ü•â Basic Level

### Tasks

- [ ] `GET` /api/events : get list of events
- [ ] `GET` /api/events/:id : get exact event
- [ ] `POST` /api/events : create a new event

## ü•à Medium Level

### Tasks

- [ ] Registration with indication of the city
- [ ] Login
- [ ] A list of events in the user's city is displayed in `/api/events` for an authorized user

## ü•á Hard Level

### Tasks

- [ ] Add paginations
- [ ] Sorting for `/api/events?sortBy=rating&sortDirection=desc`
